# What is Javascript ?

**Javascript** is a **weekly, dynamically** typed and interpreted language compiles on browser or on a host(server). Originally **Livescript** before and renamed to **Javascript**

> Dynamically typed - Any datatype value can be stored in any variable.In other words, JS assign variable values at run-time.
>
> ```js
> var a = 1;
> a = 'Javascript';
> console.log(a);
> ```
>
> Interpreted - JS code is not pre-compiled but instead compiled, evaluated, executed at runtime

* Servers

### Versions of JS

ES5, ES6 and ....,

### How to include JS in HTML

```html
<script src='path_to_js'></script>
```

> script tag is not a self closing tag. So always close the script tag.

> Also include **script** tag at the end of the file(may be after the body) or use **defer** script

#### Rules of including JS file

* Script required </script>
* Always include JS in seperate file
* Always include JS at the end of the file after body
* Order of JS matters,
  * Any dependent file should be included first
  * Any third party library JS files should be included first

### Variables and Constants

**Variables** are storage containers that stores any value inside of it

```js
var a = 1;
let b = 'JS';
const c = [1, 2, 3];
```

Reassignment of values is possible

```js
var a = 1;
a = 2;
```

#### Let

This declares/initializes a variable that can change.

```js
var a = 1;
a = 2;
```

#### Const

This initializes a variable that cannot change

```js
const a = 1;
a = 2; (Not possible, gives error)
```

> Use **constants** more often as possible.

#### Recommendation of variable naming

* Use camel case(Ex: userName)
* Use constants(const) more often
* Use Meaningful names(Ex: userName, password)

> JS is case sensitive 
>
> ```js
> var a = 1;
> var A = 1;
> ```
>
> The above two are not same

* digits are allowed at last `let age1 = 21;`
* No special characters are allowed except $ `let $myage = 21; `
* _ is allowed `let _myAge = 21;` but dont use at the word seperation(Ex: user_name).In other words **snake casing** is not recommended
* should not start with digits and special characters except $ `let 12Age = 21;`
* No keywords are allowed as variable name `let while = 1`, while is  keyword

#### Declartions

```js
let a;
```

#### Initialization

```js
let a = 0;
```

> Print any value to output using **console.log()**
>
> ```js
> let a = 0;
> console.log(a); // 0
> ```
